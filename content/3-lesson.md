# Find a suitable variable

--------

The aim of this lesson is to enhance the  `QldShark_2017_Clean_v1.csv` dataset by adding new variables, to explore if rainfall occurred on the days that sharks were captured and to add scientific names to the common shark names where possible. 

The Bureau of Meterology rainfall dataset for the Gold Coast Seaway `BOM_GCS_Rain_2017.csv` and the `NESP_SharkSpeciesList.csv` datasets could be a good matches. We will only match Gold Coast shark captures with the rainfall data in this lesson. It is possible to find and download the other relevant QLD coastal rainfall datasets from BOM.

We need to identify a common variable in each of the datasets that we can match on.  A key variable.  To do this we need to explore both datasets to see if a key or very similar variable is available that we can work with. 

Let's open another instance of OpenRefine to explore the  `BOM_GCS_Rain_2017.csv` dataset first.  

{% capture text %}
- Select the `Open` button in the top right hand corner of OpenRefine to open a new instance of the software in your browser.  
- Create a new project using  `BOM_GCS_Rain_2017.csv`  dataset
- Name it  `BOM_GCS_Rain_2017`
- Look at both datasets, what variables do they have in common?
  - `Date`  column in  `QldShark_2017_Clean_v2`
  - `Year` ,  `Month` and  `Day` columns in  `BOM_GCS_Rain_2017`.
 
These could be used as a key to match on. The unique key will be the `BOM_GCS_Rain_2017.csv` as it occurs only once per date and can be matched and added to as many dates as appropriate in the `QLDShark_2017_Clean_v2` data.

At present the date is represented in three columns, `Year`, `Month` and `Day`. We need to combine the contents of the columns into one column, and add a specific string to the new columnâ€™s values, such as a common separator, that matches the format in `QLDShark_2017_Clean_v2`.

- Go to BOM_GCS_Rain_2017 OpenRefine project
- At  `Year`  column select  `> Edit column > join columns`
- Tick  `Year` ,  `Month`  and  `Day`  boxes
- add the separator  `-` (dash) between the content of each column so it will match the date format in `QldShark_2017_Clean_v2`
- at   `Write result in new column named`  add  `Date`
- OK.
