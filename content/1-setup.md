#### About the data

We will wrangle three datasets in this workshop, all obtained from Queensland Government's open data portal [data.qld.gov.au](data.qld.gov.au). 

- The *QLD Traffic Accident* open dataset presents 17 years of traffic accidents, their location, type of accident, level of injury, and other features, with over 300,000 observations.  The data used in this workshop is a smaller four-year subset and has had changes made for training purposes. 

- The *QLD Driver Reviver Stations* open dataset provides address locations of places to stop and refresh when travelling on Queensland roads. 

- *QLD Traffic Camera Locations* is one of a number of open datasets that identify the general location of traffic cameras across Queensland. 

Each of the open datasets have been altered for training purposes. 

The workshop datasets have been stored in [Griffith University's Research Storage Space](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/).
