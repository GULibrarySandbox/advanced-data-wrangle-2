#### About the data

The datasets used in this workshop were all downloaded from the Queensland Government's open data portal [data.qld.gov.au](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/) © 2019 The State of Queensland, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence, CC BY 4.0.. 

- The *QLD Traffic Accident* open dataset presents 17 years of traffic accidents, their location, type of accident, level of injury, and other features, with over 300,000 observations. A subset of this original data has been used and altered for training purposes. 

- The *QLD Driver Reviver Stations* open dataset provides address locations of places to stop and refresh when travelling on Queensland roads. 

- *QLD Traffic Camera Locations* is one of a number of open datasets that identify the general location of traffic cameras across Queensland. 

Each of the open datasets have been altered for training purposes. 

The workshop datasets have been stored in [Griffith University's Research Storage Space](https://research-storage.griffith.edu.au/).
