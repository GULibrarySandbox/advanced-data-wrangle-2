{% include figure.html img="MapAus.JPG" alt="intro image here" caption="Image of map.Geojson file using OpenStreetMaps & Mapbox hosted in Github" width="75%" %}

This online self-paced workshop teaches advanced data wrangling skills including combining datasets, geolocating data, and “what if” exploration using OpenRefine. 

Working with data previously cleaned in [Introduction to Data wrangling with OpenRefine workshop](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/intro-data-wrangle/), learn to:

- extend data with additional variables from other data, 
- visualise geographic locations using Geo.json resulting in an interactive map 
- create a webpage to display the geographically visualised data using Github.

Download the software and dataset, do activities and watch videos to guide you through the lessons. The workshop takes around 2 hours to complete.
